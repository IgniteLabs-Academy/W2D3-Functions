# Week 2 - Day 3: Functions, Parameters & Return (Auto-Graded)

## ðŸ§  Real-World Scenario
You are building a utility library where different functions take input, process it, and return output.

## ðŸŽ¯ Task
1. Create a function `greet(name)` that returns a greeting message, and an equivalent arrow function. Log the result using `console.log`.
2. Create the following functions:
   - `add(a, b)`: Returns the sum of two numbers.
   - `multiply(x, y)`: Returns the product of two numbers.
   - `checkEven(n)`: Returns `true` if `n` is even, otherwise `false`.
   - `calculateBMI(h, w)`: Returns the BMI given height `h` (in meters) and weight `w` (in kilograms).
3. Each function should either log or return its result as appropriate.
4. Use both regular and arrow function syntax where possible (especially for `greet`).
5. Avoid common mistakes:
   - Don't forget to call your functions.
   - Use the `return` keyword when you want to send a value back.
   - Pass the correct number of arguments to each function.

## ðŸ§ª Testing & Scoring
This assignment includes 5 tests. Each test is worth 20 points. Total = 100 points.

## ðŸš€ Steps
1. Write your JavaScript code in `script.js`.
2. Follow the comments in the file.
3. Commit and push to your GitHub Classroom repo.
